## Introduction

Docvia is a SaaS platform that allows users to connect Google Docs in read-only mode and instantly deploy an AI-powered chatbot on their website. The chatbot is trained on document content and responds to user queries accurately and contextually, enabling businesses to turn documentation into interactive support or knowledge assistants.

The platform includes a robust subscription system with automatic upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and failed-payment handling. Premium users can create unlimited chatbot apps, while free users are restricted to a single active app after downgrade, ensuring fair feature access and smooth plan transitions.

Docvia also provides a fully customizable chat widget, allowing users to control branding, colors, agent identity, and UI behavior to seamlessly match their website. For easy integration, a production-ready React npm package was built and published, enabling quick chatbot deployment in React and Next.js applications with minimal setup.
